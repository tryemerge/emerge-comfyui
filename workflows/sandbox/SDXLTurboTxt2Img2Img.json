The {subject} and all details should be composed of distinct, visible threads of color. Emphasize the texture of the warp and weft, and allow some threads at the edges of forms to be frayed or loose, giving it a tactile, handmade quality.\t\n||Depict the {subject} not as a physical object, but as an invisible lens made of complexly curved glass or water. Its form is revealed only by the intricate, shimmering patterns of caustic light it refracts and focuses onto the surfaces behind it.\t\n||Render the {subject} as a semi-transparent, biological form overlaid with glowing, white-on-blue architectural blueprint lines. These schematics should map out its internal structures, stress points, and energy flows as if it were a meticulously designed organic machine.\t\n||Illustrate the image as if it were drawn with a single drop of colored ink on highly absorbent paper. The {subject} is formed by the feathery, branching patterns of the ink as it bleeds and chromatographically separates into its component colors across the page.\t\n||Transform the image using the Sabattier effect (solarization) of darkroom photography. The mid-tones should be partially reversed, creating a surreal, metallic look where dark areas are edged with bright, silvery lines, making the {subject} appear as a metallic ghost in a world of inverted light.\t\n||Reconstruct the entire scene, including the {subject}, as if it were made from a single, vast sheet of intricately folded paper.
